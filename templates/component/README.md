# "<%= name %>"

This is where I should describe the purpose of my A-Frame component that I created using aframe-typescript-toolkit

# Building the example

1. `yarn install` to install the dependencies.

2. `yarn build` to create CDN publishable artifacts in the `dist-umd` folder.

3. run `yarn serve` to see the component in action. 

# Making the component globally useable

Exposing `dist-umd` via a CDN such as rawgit or jsdelivr will make it easy for 3rd party developers to use this a-frame artifact.
